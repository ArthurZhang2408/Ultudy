## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:
- **[DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](../../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)** - Complete documentation index
- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Project overview and quick start
- **[SCALABILITY_GUIDE.md](../../SCALABILITY_GUIDE.md)** - Current scaling guide

## Why These Are Archived

These documents describe:
1. **Completed work** - Implementation plans that have been finished
2. **Deprecated features** - Systems that have been removed (e.g., embeddings/RAG)
3. **Replaced approaches** - Old architectures superseded by new designs
4. **Historical context** - Useful for understanding project evolution

## Should You Read These?

**No**, unless you are:
- Researching project history
- Understanding why certain decisions were made
- Looking for historical context on architecture choices

**Instead, read:**
- Current docs in the root directory
- [DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](../../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) for navigation

**Note:** Do not reference these docs in new code or documentation. They are kept purely for historical reference.
